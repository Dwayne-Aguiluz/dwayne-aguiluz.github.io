<h1> Intrams </h1>

<h3>What is the most important thing I learned from the event? </h3> <br>
<p>
The most important I have learned is to cooperate with my teammates in working towards one goal, i have learned that the goal of these sports is not only just to win, but to also socialize with everyone, achieving friendship.
</p><br>

<h3> How can I apply what i have learned in real life situations? </h3> <br>
<p>
By thinking of the positives rather than the negative when we lose, that Basketball is not just about winning, but learning to employ camaraderie in my future games.
</p><br>

<h3> Did I actively participate in the event? How? </h3> <br>
<p>
I actively participated, by playing basketball and cheering for our team in other sports or games.
</p><br>

<h3> If i were to teach this topic/subject to a classmate, how would I explain it? </h3> <br>
<p>
I will explain the things that occur within the intrams and what the benefits would be in joining these events.
</p><br>

<h3> Why is it important to have an event (per subject)? Explain your answer. </h3> <br>
<p> 
It is important to have an event for the MAPEH subject because exercise is important, and sometimes students have no exercise at all, because they focus on their academics and studies.
This event in particular, is very important also because it teaches us to engage in sports, unlocking our potential that we didnâ€™t know we had in sports and to learn how to cooperate with our teammates, these kinds of events are the ones that bring fun and joy where you can play with other grade levels, socializing and gaining a healthy relationship with everyone around the school
